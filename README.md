Matrix-
=======

Java program for matrix calculator


To compile, open a terminal in Linux/Unix, cd to the directory that contains these files, and run the following command line:
make

To run the program, still in the previous terminal, run the following command:
java MatrixWindow

And then fowllow the instructions on the popped window. 

When prompted to enter your matrix, note that only decimal number will be accpeted. No fractions. 

The program will not give the correct result if all the eigenvalues of your matrix are of the same magnitude. Especially, this program will not give the correct eigenvalues for an orthogonal matrix unless the orthogonal matrix is very special, for example, an identity matrix. This is a bug that I hope to fix in the future.
